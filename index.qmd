The purpose of this website is to test a workflow for persistent [jspsych](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/) experiments using static webpages. 

1. The experiment is hosted on this github repository. 
2. Data is sent to an [OSF](https://osf.io) storage bucket using [datapipe](https://pipe.jspsych.org).
3. Find out if it is possible to use [webR](https://github.com/r-wasm/webr) to import data from osf, then analyse and plot it.

# Flanker experiment

This is just a demo to test the workflow. Clicking this link will load a short 24 trial flanker experiment. No identifying information is collected. The workflow includes sending the reaction time data from each trial to a repository on open-science foundation.

[ x ] - code flanker experiment

[ ] - make OSF repository

[ ] - add datapipe to send data to OSF repository
